### It was my first year at UCSC.
I went into a large room filled with miscellaneous tabletop prototyping supplies to work on a board game for a class and I saw a poster for the Game Design and Art Collaboration Club. Turns out, they held meetings in the room. I joined shortly after, and this was the first game I worked on during their Mock Studio, which ran during the winter and fall quarters.

I initally wanted to join the studio as a programmer, but I felt like I wouldn't be able to contribute as much. I was only starting to learn how to program for games, and I never opened Unity before. I might have written one line of code when I was trying to figure out what a rigidbody was and how to calculate its velocity before I switched gears. You might be able to find me in the credits as a programmer.

I had enjoyed making music as a hobby, and I felt confident in my ability to make music quickly with a theme or a purpose in mind.
### So, I joined the sound department.
